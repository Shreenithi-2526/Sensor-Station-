SENSOR STATION – Project Description

PURPOSE
1. 	A sensor station is a compact device that can display the climatic conditions to the users such as: 
•	Temperature
•	Humidity
2. 	It shows real time data with a buzzer included in the design to notify the users if values are beyond a certain range.
3. The sensor station is widely used in the automotive or smartwatch industry.	
4. It would also be useful to monitor the temperature/pressure conditions in cold storage of restaurants.	
5. The project can also include IOT by connecting to a device to display the values.
